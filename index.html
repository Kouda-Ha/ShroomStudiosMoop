  <h2>About Shroom Studios</h2>
  <p>
  Shroom Studios consists of 6 members, who are second year students at the Manchester Metropolitan University. Our initials when put together spelled out 'S H R O O M' so we decided to make that our group name.
  <br>
  The project we were placed on to was for a 'Skills Teaching Game' and with members of the group having previous experience with First-Person Shooters, making Japanese language resources, and making videogames, the team decided on an FPS that teaches you Japanese.
  <br>
  Due to the time restraint and the vastness that the project entailed, this website was made along side the videogame so that users of the game can still learn Japanese and consolidate their learning.
  <br>
  This is done via seeing all vocabulary used in the game here, on this website, as well as the extra content we were unable to put into the game, due to the time constraint.
  <br>
  With the content on the game and on here, users should be able to communicate in short and simple sentences in Japanese. It should also give users a baseline and help them with continuing their learning with more complicated
   sentence structures and so on.
  <br>
  All of us at Shroom Studios hope you enjoy the game and learning material provided! It was the first group project anybody had ever had to do before, and we were all pretty much complete strangers before it! So it was a real but rather fun challenge. 
  <br>
  Special thanks:
  <br>
